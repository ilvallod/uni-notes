Here is a collection of my university course notes from the University of Milan. The notes are written in the language of the course, either Italian or English.

There might be some errors, perhaps due to moments of leisure with LaTeX or some uncertainties in translation. I'm open to any kind of contribution, so please don't hesitate to let me know if you've noticed any errors!
