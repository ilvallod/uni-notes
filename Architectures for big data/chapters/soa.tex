\section{SOA: Service Oriented Architecture}
The basis of SOA is to bridge the IT and business worlds

\paragraph{IBM definition}
SOA is an architectural style for creating an enterprise IT ar-
chitecture that leverages the principles of service orientation to achieve a closer
relationship between the business and the information systems that support it.
The \textit{SOA stack} is envisioned as an architecture with 5 layers
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Operating systems}
    \item \textit{Service components}
    \item \textit{Services}
    \item \textit{Business processes}
    \item \textit{Clients}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Service} 
A service is a resource identified by a name that performs a repetitive business task with a specified outcome. Each service consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Name
    \item Version
    \item Execution type: asynchronous, synchronous
    \item Logging method: before, after
    \item Message in: configuration of incoming messages
    \item Message out: configuration of outgoing messages
    \item Visibility
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Server catalog} 
Catalog of all available services

\paragraph{Service queue} 
List of service executions
