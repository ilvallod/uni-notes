\section{Delta lake}
Delta Lake aims to ensure ACID properties on HDFS, therefore on distributed storage.

\paragraph{Transaction} 
Sequence of operations satisfying ACID properties

\paragraph{ACID properties} 
Properties that are necessary to ensure transactionality
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Atomicity}, each operation of a transaction is atomic
    \item \textit{Consistency}, a transaction must maintain the consistency of the system
    \item \textit{Isolation}, concurrent executions lead to the same result as sequential executions
    \item \textit{Durability}, a transaction cannot be restored after a commit
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Transacion logs} History of the operations performed by a database, can be useful for rollbacks in cases where some transactions have failed

\paragraph{Log shipping} Logs can be sent to a server to replicate the state of the database and have an exact copy of the system

\paragraph{Delta Lake features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Time travel}, possibility of returning the storage state to a specific time snapshot
    \item \textit{UPSERT, DELETE and MERGE}
    \item \textit{Efficient streaming}, information is written quickly since it is divided into small blocks. Blocks are joined together later to speed up readings
    \item \textit{Caching}, cluster nodes can cache information
\end{itemize}
