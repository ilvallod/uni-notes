\section{MapReduce}
MapReduce is a programming model that was introduced in a Google paper in $2003$ with the aim of accelerating parallel processing of multiple nodes. It works by combining a \textit{map} function, which transforms the input data into key-value pairs, with a \textit{reduce} function, that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.

We starting to split using the key, a key is not a unique key, is something you would like to aggregate. A single key is only on a given node. MapReduce works well if you’re able to reduce the communication between the nodes.

Then apply the reduce. It takes couple of rows with the same key and then apply a function to the two value until couple by couple there’re no more couple of lines with the same key
